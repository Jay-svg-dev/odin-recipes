        <h2>Perfect for the Fall!</h2>
        <p><em>"This warm and hearty chicken dinner is perfect for the fall. Onions are simmered in apple cider and chicken stock before being baked with chicken thighs, apples, and cream."</em></p>
    </div>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (4 ounce) bone-in, skin on chicken thighs</li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup apple cider</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 medium apples, sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Season both sides of the chicken thighs with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep oven-proof skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add chicken thighs to the hot oil and cook until browned on both sides, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Add sliced onions to the skillet and saute until they just start to brown, about 3 minutes. Pour in apple cider and chicken stock, scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen any browned bits. Stir in thyme and salt. Simmer until the onions are soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Add chicken back to the skillet and spoon some sauce over the top. Arrange sliced apples around the chicken. Cover the skillet with a lid or aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove skillet from the oven and carefully uncover. Transfer chicken from the skillet to a plate and keep warm. Whisk heavy cream and cornstarch together in a small bowl. Stir gently into the sauce in the skillet. Place chicken back into the skillet and spoon some of the sauce over the chicken.</li>
        <li>Return skillet to the oven and bake, uncovered, until the chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, and an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes more. Serve chicken and apples with the sauce.</li>
